To complete the work, contractor crews will now close Wellesley Avenue starting Tuesday, May 28, between Market Street and Freya Street. Crews will also close the northbound lanes of the North Spokane Corridor between Wellesley Avenue and the Freya Street interchange. The southbound lanes closed earlier this week on Monday, May 20.</description>
