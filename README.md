# RSS

A Clojure application designed to parse articles from RSS feeds, and 
(optionally) publish new articles through the Oracle Notification Service (ONS).

## Usage

Build with Leiningen e.g. `lein uberjar`

*java -jar <this-uberjar.jar> [/path/to/config]*

[/path/to/config] may be omitted, in which case ~/.rss will be used by default.

The config file must be a valid XML file matching the following example format:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<topic ocid='ocid1.onstopic.phx.your.ocid.here' client='file'>
    <feed link='https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwaatmget.php?x=WAC033'/>
    <feed link='https://www.nps.gov/feeds/getNewsRSS.htm?id=mora'/>
</topic>
```

To use ONS for notifications, define both a topic OCID in the `ocid` 
attribute and a client type in the `client` attribute of the `topic` tag.
The `ocid` refers to the OCID of your notification topic, and the `client` is
a value of `file` or `instance`, for OCI file-based client configuration or 
instance principal-based client configuration, respectively.

If the `ocid` or `client` attributes are omitted, articles will be printed to 
standard output only.

Note that in order to leverage use of ONS, you must have a tenancy 
configured with an ONS topic defined with one or more subscribers. To use 
the file-based OCI client, you must have a valid configuration in the `.oci` 
folder. To use the instance principal-based OCI client, this application 
must be running on an OCI instance and your tenancy must be configured with 
a policy to allow the instance to access your topic. See here for guidance: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm

## Docker

You may build the application into an Docker image using the included example
Dockerfile, and run it as follows (example):

`docker run -d -v $HOME/.rss:/app/rss.xml rss-clj`
